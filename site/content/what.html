We write the software that makes your life easier.

Sound simple? We hope so.

For those in the know, some of us like Ruby on Rails, some of us like Ubuntu and some of us even like real electronics... but we're mostly ambitechstrous.

_What have we worked on in the past?_

The biggest project any of our number have created recently was a piece of large-scale child protection software for schools. In recent years, we've all been involved in various small-to-medium projects for a whole range of purposes across the private and public sector.

We think being a small team is awesome, as we can bring you complete flexibility, enthusiasm and a broad range of skills that are matched to your needs.
