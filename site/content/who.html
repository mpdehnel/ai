We're a small group of professional geeks who get a kick out of making people's lives easier.

__Martin__ is a computer scientist and mathematician with a particular interest in community and educational projects, whether software or electronics based. In his spare time he's a choral scholar and [photographer](http://www.flickr.com/photos/13938003@N02/ "Martin Dehnel on Flickr").

__[James](http://jamesinman.co.uk/ "JamesInman.co.uk")__ has been writing educational software for 2-3 years now for schools across the country, after seeing a gap in the market for software that makes a real difference to pupils' and teachers' lives. 

__Pete__ likes ale, whisky, and Hip-Hopera. When not in his spare time, he's an electronic engineer, specialising in Neural Networks.

__Tom__ is also a mathematician and computer scientist, who's as happy on the water as off.

...and __[James](https://github.com/jamesfielder "James Fielder")__ (yes, another one) likes [penguins](https://www.archlinux.org/ "penguins").
