![Who are we?](/images/who.png "Who are we?")

We're an ad-hoc group of consultants (well, professional geeks) who get a kick out of making people's lives easier.

__Martin__ is a big, ginger yeti.

__James__ is a flying spaghetti monster.

__Pete__ likes ale, whisky, and Hip-Hopera.

__Tom__ likes limousines. (No really, ask him about it)

...and __James__ (yes, another one) likes penguins.
